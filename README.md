## Description
The year was 2020. Massive sporting events have been cancelled. Raymond James is closed, and so is The Bounce House. So how do we settle the War on I-4 rivalry?

Obviously, by competing in a hackathon to create KnightRider, a digital bull-riding experience with trace amounts of trademark violations (*It's parody so it's probably fine.*).

Load the website on your phone, press Play, and then tilt your phone to control NotKnightro, who is riding on top of NotRocky. Don't mind their appearances; our NotLawyers *swear* they are legally distinct and not stolen off of Google Images. Try to stay on NotRocky as long as possible and get the high score! Will you represent your school and top the leaderboards?

*Please don't sue us.*

## Features

- Get a text message whenever you drop off the leaderboard
- Share your high scores with friends with a single tap with all of your favorite apps
